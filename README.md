# Personal Portfolio Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I plan on hosting this site to show case all of my development skills that I will be learning for the rest of my career. I plan on linking all of my projects, demonstring my skills through demos, and using the site as a vlog. Look for more in the future!
